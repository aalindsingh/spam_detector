# spam_detector
The dataset that we used for the project is the Enron email dataset. The full dataset is available in the repository along with the training and test sets,
otherwise the original dataset is available on the web here: http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/. The dataset is a collection of public domain 
emails from the Enron corporation. The emails have been manually classified as spam and non-spam. The primary goal of the project is to create a supervised
classification pipeline to classify emails as spam or non-spam from the training data.
